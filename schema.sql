(40, 2, '<h4>Cold-blooded and warm-blooded</h4>\r\n<p>Animals have two basic strategies for coping with the temperature changes on earth.  The first to evolve was cold-bloodedness, the second was warm bloodedness.  Both have advantages and disadvantages in how and where an animal survives. The term bloodedness is confusing.  The temperature of a body influences all of the body and all of its tissues, not just the blood. So every cell in a body needs to stay within particular temperature ranges in order for each cell to do its individual action most efficiently.</p>\r\n    <p>Cold-blooded is a term that refers to the act of thermoregulation by its placement in the environment.   An individual animal may choose where it sits or lives or it may be chosen for it by the acts of other organisms.  For instance a tent caterpillar moth may not have the choice of where it lives; this having been chosen by its mother when she laid her eggs.  The caterpillar after hatching may choose to sit on the warm side of the tree or the cool side of the tree, depending on what other biological forces are driving it.</p>\r\n	<p>A turtle will come out of a burrow and sit directly in the sun in order to warm its body. It probably does this because it feels good to bask.  That behavior has important biological outcomes.  Growth, metabolism and reproduction are all driven in part by the warmth the animal achieves by sitting where it feels good.  When internal temperatures rise too far the turtle may walk to the shade or even submerge in water.  Thermoregulation in a cold-blooded animal is an act of behavior. It requires energy and resources at particular decision points when the animal decides to thermoregulate by changing position in the environment.</p>\r\n	<p>Warm-blooded is devoid of behavioral decision making on the part of the animal.  It is true that a warm-blooded animal may mimic and derive benefit by positioning itself in the environment but the primary mechanism for thermoregulation is a biochemical and ultimately a physiological one. </p>\r\n 	<p>It requires a steady flow of energy to maintain a constant temperature.  As a result warm blooded animals have a constant requirement for taking in food supplies, whereas cold-blooded animals are freed from eating except when they are active.  Although warm-blooded animals are required to maintain a steady intake of food, they are relatively free to go in search of that food in places where temperatures may become extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Fast twitch and slow twitch muscle</h4>\r\n        <p>The unit of fuel within the individual cell of the body is a substance called ATP (adenotriphosphate).  There are two major ways to convert raw resource into ATP.  One way requires a large, steady supply of oxygen (this is why we have lungs and breathe). The other way does not.  The muscles of the body that require oxygen for the development of ATP are called slow twitch muscle (or red muscle); the muscles that require little oxygen are fast twitch muscle (or white muscle.)</p>\r\n	<p>Fish, amphibians, and many reptiles have a large proportion of fast twitch (white) muscle.  They require little oxygen for movement and function.  Birds and mammals are built of mostly aerobic (oxygen requiring) muscle.  Slow twitch muscle requires a steady flow of oxygen (constant breathing). Fast twitch muscle performs much faster than slow twitch muscle. For instance a rattlesnake can strike much faster than you can move your leg away. Rattlesnakes are comprised of mostly fast twitch, low oxygen requiring muscle.  Humans are mostly comprised of slow twitch, oxygen requiring muscle.  But these phenomena are not exclusive to one group of vertebrates or another.</p>\r\n	<p>Lots of animals have some proportion of both slow twitch and fast twitch in their bodies.  For instance a chicken has fast twitch muscle in its breast, hence the white meat because fewer blood vessels carrying oxygen to the muscle is required.  The legs, the dark meat, are slow twitch aerobic muscle with a high proportion of blood vessels.  Chickens walk around a lot, and fly with only a fast burst of wing flapping when they are trying to get away from a predator.</p>\r\n<h4>Links</h4>\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" target="_blank">Wikipedia Warm-blooded</a>\r\n<p>Wikipedia and Cool Cosmos out of Caltech both have articles that accurately explore the concepts of warm- and cold-bloodedness.  Search Google under Warm-blooded.</p>\r\n<p>Fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles are explained further in an article in Wikipedia about Muscle.</p>\r\n', 'Cold blooded vs. warm blooded.
